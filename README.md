# Tunify Platform

## Description

Tunify Platform is a comprehensive music management system designed to enhance the user experience in managing their music preferences. It allows users to create and manage playlists, discover new songs, and follow their favorite artists. The platform integrates a variety of features such as subscription management, playlist creation, and song organization.

## Overview of Relationships

The Tunify Platform uses several key entities, each of which is related to others in specific ways. Here is an overview of the relationships:

1. **Users**:
   - **Properties**: `UsersId`, `Username`, `Email`, `Join_Date`, `Subscription_ID`
   - **Relationships**: 
     - Each user can have one or more playlists.
     - A user is associated with a subscription.

2. **Subscription**:
   - **Properties**: `SubscriptionId`, `Subscription_Type`, `Price`
   - **Relationships**:
     - A subscription is linked to one or more users.

3. **Song**:
   - **Properties**: `SongId`, `Title`, `ArtistId`
   - **Relationships**:
     - Each song is associated with one artist.
     - Songs can be included in multiple playlists through the `PlaylistSongs` entity.

4. **PlaylistSongs**:
   - **Properties**: `PlaylistSongsId`, `PlaylistId`, `SongId`
   - **Relationships**:
     - Links a song to a specific playlist.

5. **Playlist**:
   - **Properties**: `PlaylistId`, `UsersId`, `Playlist_Name`, `Created_Date`
   - **Relationships**:
     - Each playlist is owned by a user.
     - Playlists contain multiple songs through the `PlaylistSongs` entity.

6. **Artist**:
   - **Properties**: `ArtistId`, `Name`, `Bio`
   - **Relationships**:
     - An artist can have multiple songs.
     - An artist can have multiple albums.

7. **Album**:
   - **Properties**: `AlbumId`, `Album_Name`, `Release_Date`, `ArtistId`
   - **Relationships**:
     - An album is associated with one artist.
     - Albums can contain multiple songs (though the relationship is not explicitly defined in the current model).

## Repository Design Pattern

### Explanation

The Repository Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a centralized place to manage data access logic, separating it from the business logic of an application. It involves creating repository classes that handle all data operations related to specific entities.

### Benefits

- **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the data access logic, providing a clean separation between the business logic and data access layers.
- **Testability**: By abstracting the data access logic, it becomes easier to write unit tests for the business logic without relying on the actual database.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the data access logic are localized within the repository classes, making the codebase easier to maintain and refactor.
- **Reusability**: Repository classes can be reused across different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
- **Consistency**: By centralizing data access logic, it ensures consistent data operations throughout the application.

### Implementation in Tunify Platform

In the Tunify Platform, we use the `TunifyDbContext` to manage the database operations for the entities. Each entity has a corresponding repository class that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as any additional data operations required by the business logic. For example:

- **UserRepository**: Manages data operations for the `Users` entity.
- **SongRepository**: Manages data operations for the `Song` entity.
- **PlaylistRepository**: Manages data operations for the `Playlist` entity.
- **ArtistRepository**: Manages data operations for the `Artist` entity.

Each repository class interacts with the `TunifyDbContext` to perform database operations, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and a more maintainable codebase.


## Additional Information

- **Database Context**: `TunifyDbContext` is used to manage the database operations for the entities.
- **Seeding Data**: Initial data for users, artists, songs, and playlists is seeded into the database to facilitate testing and development.
